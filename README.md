## Overview
Project Overview
This fitness analytics project goes beyond traditional workout tracking by uncovering 
data-driven insights into personal health and exercise performance. By leveraging

a comprehensive understanding of how various factors intersect to influence fitness outcomes.

Analysis provides insights into:

- Optimal workout timing and intensity
- Environmental impacts on exercise performance
- Personalized energy expenditure patterns
- Workout consistency and progression
